Sanskrit Wisdom Interpreter:

This is a Python-based console application that displays selected Sanskrit shlokas along with their English meanings. The program also converts the English meaning into speech using a text-to-speech engine.
The goal of this project was to practice Python fundamentals while building something meaningful and interactive.

Features:
  Displays a list of Sanskrit shlokas
  Shows the English meaning of the selected shloka
  Converts the meaning into audio
  Automatically plays the generated speech
  Technologies Used
  Python
  pyttsx3

Then run: 
python sanskrit_wisdom_interpreter.py

Future Scope:
  Add topic-based search using NLP

This project helped me strengthen my Python basics and explore text-to-speech integration in real applications.
