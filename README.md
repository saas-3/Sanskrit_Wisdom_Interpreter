# Sanskrit Wisdom Interpreter

This is a beginner-level Python project where I built a simple console application that displays selected Sanskrit shlokas along with their English meanings.

The program also converts the English meaning into speech using a text-to-speech engine, making the experience interactive and easier to understand.

## What I Did
- Stored shlokas and meanings using a dictionary
- Displayed a list of selectable shlokas
- Showed the corresponding English meaning
- Converted the meaning into audio using text-to-speech
- Automatically played the generated audio file

## Tools Used
Python, pyttsx3, winsound

## How to Run
Install the required library:
pip install pyttsx3

Then run:
python sanskrit_wisdom_interpreter.py

## Future Scope
- Add topic-based search using NLP
- Convert the project into a web application
- Store shlokas in a cloud database

This project helped me strengthen my Python fundamentals and understand how text-to-speech integration works in real applications.
